# KSPTwo

### Kerbal Space Program Two: Electric Joolabaloo

A modpack for Kerbal Space Program, because KSP2 never happened and doesn't exist. A derivative of the [Community Lifeboat Project](https://github.com/mystwalkerKSP/Kerbal-Space-Program-Community-Lifeboat-Project).

---

Description inside the modpack itself: Because KSP2 was bad, we made a better version of KSP2. Based on the Community Lifeboat Modpack (2), now with bugfixes, some additions like RealPlume, and some removals. This should be the only modpack you'll ever need.

Recommended Blackracks Clouds (from Patreon or Discord) or Astronomer's Visual Pack. ♥️
