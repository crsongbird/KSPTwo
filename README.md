# KSPTwo

### Kerbal Space Program Two: Electric Joolabaloo

A modpack for Kerbal Space Program, because KSP2 never happened and doesn't exist. A derivative of the [Community Lifeboat Project](https://github.com/mystwalkerKSP/Kerbal-Space-Program-Community-Lifeboat-Project).

### Instructions
Install the Steam version of KSP.
Download [CKAN Mod Manager for KSP](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases). 
Download the .ckan file.
Import the file with CKAN.
Download and install all the mods.

### The Description inside the modpack itself

Because KSP2 was bad, we made a better version of KSP2. Based on the Community Lifeboat Modpack (2), now with bugfixes, some additions like RealPlume, and some removals. This should be the only modpack you'll ever need.
